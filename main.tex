\section{Hello World!}

\textbf{Hello World!} Today I am learning \LaTeX.
\LaTeX{} is a great program for writing math. I can write in line math such as \(a^2+b^2=c^2\)
\begin{equation}
    \gamma^2+\theta^2=\omega^2
\end{equation}
If I do not leave any blank lines \LaTeX{} will continue  this text without making it into a new paragraph.  Notice how there was no indentation in the text after equation (1).
Also notice how even though I hit enter after that sentence and here \LaTeX{} formats the sentence without any break. Formats the sentence without any break.
